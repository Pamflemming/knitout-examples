# Knitout Examples

This repository contains a collection of example knitting patterns in knitout format.

Some of these are hand-coded, while others are generated by code. Some of the javascript examples use the [knitout frontend package](https://github.com/textiles-lab/knitout-frontend-js) to write knitout. It is recommended to use npm and run `npm install` to install knitout as a local node module. If you don't want to use npm, you can also download the package directly from the git repo and put it in the appropriate folders and/or mess with the `require()` in the examples.
